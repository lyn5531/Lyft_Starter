# Starter Repo

## Project Overview
This Python project provides a system to determine the serviceability of cars based on their engine and battery conditions. Utilizing principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it employs a composition over inheritance approach, where a car is composed of different parts, and each part has its own serviceability check.
